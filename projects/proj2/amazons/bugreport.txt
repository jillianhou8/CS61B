Hello! I've been stuck on this bug this entire day...The issue is that when I run main and have one manual player and one auto player,
the auto player always moves pieces of MY side. If auto is black, it moves white pieces, and if its white, it moves only black pieces.
Also, when I play with two manuals, I am able to move pieces of both sides... I have checked that I switch the turn both in makeMove and undo
in Board.java, and my isLegal should already be checking if the piece in whichever from square passed in is of the correct side (_turn).

I'm not sure where else to find the error, perhaps in my findMove in AI? I would really appreciate any guidance on this! On both why the auto plays
opposite to what it should, as well why manual players are not being restricted to only moving pieces of its own side. Not sure if these are
related.

Thank you so much in advance.
